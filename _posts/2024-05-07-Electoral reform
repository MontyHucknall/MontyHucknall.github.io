### Transcript

Hello ladies and gentleman. I’m here today on the 4th of July 2024 standing outside of my town’s polling station because it is my belief that 16-17 should have the right to participate in an election such as this.

But greater than that, our entire political system is broken. Politicians can take their position in power for granted since our voting system does not work on proportionality but rather outdated bureaucracy. Furthermore, there is currently no limit on the amount of bribes, sorry, I mean donations that political parties can receive to sway their policies.

If we want to fix our country, we must start by fixing the foundation on which policy is built.

If you believe in fair democracy for our country, consider voting liberal democrats. Because I can’t.

They promise to bring real electoral reform as well as so many other powerful policies that set our nation's economy up to flourish in the future and destroy our nation’s seeming decline.
