# Welcome to MontyPublished!

This site is dedicated to showcasing my various projects and publications. There's no specific theme or criteria here; I'll simply archive work that I've done for academic or personal reasons. Content isn't created specifically for the site, but rather uploaded as I complete different projects.

One thing you can expect regularly is my monthly Economic Update. This update focuses primarily on the UK, highlighting changes in the economic landscape and touching on relevant political developments due to their close interconnection.

Stay tuned for more updates and new content.
